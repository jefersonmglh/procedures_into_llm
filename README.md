# Exploring Chatbots and Advanced Natural Language Models to Facilitate Access to Operational Procedures in Laboratories.

<p>This project aimed to employ chatbots and advanced natural language processing models to facilitate the consultation and understanding of operational procedures in laboratory environments. Through the implementation of artificial intelligence techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs), our goal was to develop an interface that allowed users to access and interpret procedures effectively, quickly, and independently.
